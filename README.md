# 🧠 Greedy TSP Solver

A basic implementation of a greedy algorithm to approximate solutions for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). This project is built using Python and demonstrates how a nearest-neighbor approach can be used to traverse nodes efficiently.

## 🚀 Features

* **Simple Algorithm**: Uses the greedy approach to choose the nearest unvisited city at each step.
* **Educational Value**: Great for learning how greedy algorithms work for optimization problems.
* **Minimal Requirements**: Requires only Python and the `matplotlib` library for optional visualization.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**: Main programming language.
* **matplotlib**: (Optional) Used for plotting the path taken by the algorithm.

## 📂 Project Structure

* `greedy_tsp.py`: Main Python script implementing the greedy solution for the TSP.

## 📸 Screenshots

*Note: Add a screenshot of the plotted tour if matplotlib visualization is used.*

## 📈 Future Enhancements

* **Better Visualizations**: Include matplotlib plots of the route.
* **Distance Matrix Support**: Allow loading from distance matrix files.
* **Benchmarking**: Add performance comparison against other algorithms.
